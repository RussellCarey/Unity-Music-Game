# Various Music Games

I first started programming back in late 2019 because I wanted to make a music game.  

I 'studied' C# and Unity with the intention just to create a music game for fun.

I ended up creating web and mobile based games, unreleased due to my lack of skill at the time.

This is where I found my love for programming and combing art, design and coding together. 

I then moved to JavaScript and the Web to continue this further.
